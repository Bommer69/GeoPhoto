# CODING RULES
1. **Backend:**
   - Always handle `ImageProcessingException` when reading files.
   - Expose a static resource handler for the `/uploads` directory so images are accessible via URL.
   - Use standard RESTful API naming conventions.
   - Use DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) for API responses, do not expose Entities directly.

2. **Frontend:**
   - Use Functional Components and Hooks.
   - Markers on the map MUST be custom icons (thumbnails of the photos).
   - Use `MarkerClusterGroup` to group photos when zoomed out.
   - Ensure the Map takes 100% height and width of the container.

3. **General:**
   - Keep code clean, modular, and well-commented.
   - If a file becomes too large, suggest refactoring/splitting it.
